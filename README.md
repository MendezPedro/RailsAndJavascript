![coffi](app/assets/images/diagrama.png)

As it can be seen above, the relation it is a *has_many* association and the models are generated as it follows:

```console
rails g model Coffe name price:integer origin blend
rails g model Sale amount:integer coffe:references
```

In the models the relation is added as:

```ruby
class Coffi < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :sales
end
```

```ruby
class Sale < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :coffe
end
```

It is checked in the Rails console as:

```console
Coffi.new.sales
Sale.new.coffi
```

```console
rails g controller Dashboard index
```
